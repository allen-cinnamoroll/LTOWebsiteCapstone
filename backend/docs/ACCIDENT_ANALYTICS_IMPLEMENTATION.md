# Accident Analytics Implementation

## Overview
I have successfully implemented a comprehensive accident analytics page for the LTO Website Capstone project. The implementation includes both backend analytics endpoints and a rich frontend dashboard with multiple visualizations.

## Backend Implementation

### Analytics Endpoints
The backend already had comprehensive accident analytics endpoints implemented in `backend/controller/accidentController.js`:

1. **`GET /accident/analytics/summary`** - Provides comprehensive accident analytics including:
   - Total accidents with period comparison
   - Fatal accidents count and trends
   - Severity distribution (minor, moderate, severe, fatal)
   - Vehicle type distribution
   - Monthly trends
   - Municipality distribution
   - Geographic data with coordinates

2. **`GET /accident/analytics/risk`** - Provides ML-based risk analysis including:
   - Risk level distribution (high, medium, low)
   - Rule-based detection results
   - Risk predictions with confidence scores

### Data Model
The accident data model (`backend/model/AccidentModel.js`) includes:
- `accident_id`: Unique identifier
- `plateNo`: Vehicle plate number
- `accident_date`: Date of accident
- `street`, `barangay`, `municipality`: Location details
- `vehicle_type`: Type of vehicle involved
- `severity`: Accident severity level
- `coordinates`: GPS coordinates for mapping
- `notes`: Additional details

## Frontend Implementation

### Component Structure
The accident analytics component (`frontend/src/components/analytics/accident/AccidentAnalytics.jsx`) includes:

#### 1. Summary Cards
- **Total Accidents**: Shows total count with percentage change from previous period
- **Fatal Accidents**: Displays fatal accident count with trend indicators
- **High Risk Areas**: Shows number of municipalities with accidents
- **Risk Predictions**: Displays percentage of high-risk predictions

#### 2. Interactive Charts
- **Accident Trends Over Time**: Area chart showing monthly accident frequency
- **Severity Distribution**: Pie chart breaking down accidents by severity
- **Vehicle Type Distribution**: Bar chart showing accidents by vehicle type
- **Top Municipalities**: Bar chart of municipalities with highest accident counts

#### 3. Risk Analysis
- **ML-based Risk Distribution**: Shows high, medium, and low risk predictions
- **Rule-based Detection**: Traditional risk assessment results

#### 4. Interactive Geographic Map
- **Interactive Map**: Full-featured map showing accident locations
- **Color-coded Markers**: Different colors for accident severity levels
- **Detailed Popups**: Click markers to see accident details
- **Auto-fit Bounds**: Map automatically adjusts to show all accident locations
- **Navigation Controls**: Zoom and pan controls for exploration
- **Legend**: Visual guide for severity color coding

### Features
- **Time Period Selection**: Dropdown to filter data by week, month, 3 months, 6 months, or year
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Real-time Data**: Fetches live data from backend APIs
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with loading states
- **Interactive Charts**: Hover tooltips and responsive chart interactions

### Dependencies Used
- **Recharts**: For all chart visualizations (already installed)
- **Mapbox GL JS**: For interactive maps (already installed)
- **Lucide React**: For icons (already installed)
- **Radix UI**: For UI components (already installed)
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling (already installed)

## API Integration
The component integrates with the existing authentication system and uses the configured API client (`frontend/src/api/axios.js`) to fetch data from the backend endpoints.

## Data Flow
1. Component mounts and fetches analytics data based on selected time period
2. Backend processes the request and returns aggregated data
3. Frontend formats the data for chart visualization
4. Charts render with interactive features
5. Users can change time periods to see different data views

## Usage
The accident analytics page is accessible through the existing routing system and can be navigated to via the `AccidentAnalyticsPage.jsx` component.

## Map Configuration
The interactive map uses Mapbox GL JS. To get the best experience:

1. **Get a free Mapbox token** from [mapbox.com](https://mapbox.com)
2. **Create a `.env` file** in the frontend directory with:
   ```
   VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token_here
   ```
3. **Restart the development server** after adding the token

The map will work with a default token for basic functionality, but a personal token provides better performance and customization options.

## Future Enhancements
- Heat map visualization using the coordinate data
- Cluster markers for dense areas
- Export functionality for reports
- Real-time updates with WebSocket integration
- Advanced filtering options
- Comparative analysis between different time periods
- Integration with prediction models for forecasting
- Street view integration for accident locations

## Testing
The implementation has been tested with:
- Different time period selections
- Error handling scenarios
- Responsive design on various screen sizes
- Chart interactions and tooltips

The accident analytics page is now fully functional and provides comprehensive insights into accident data with beautiful visualizations and interactive features.
